# REPOSITORY SETUP

This repository contains the final Arduino control code used during the development and testing of the oxygen mixing module. To ensure long-term ownership, maintainability, and version control, it is recommended that the client create and maintain a dedicated GitHub repository for this codebase.

Before any further development, all files in this repository should be saved and transferred into a new, client-owned repository. This includes the standalone solenoid control code, standalone pressure sensor code, integrated blender controller, and all associated custom libraries. The provided README should also be copied across to preserve usage instructions, safety notes, and system context.

Once the new repository has been created, it is recommended that the original development repository be archived or set to read-only to prevent confusion between legacy development code and the final handover version. Any future modifications, testing, or extensions should be carried out exclusively within the client-owned repository to maintain clear version history and accountability.

If required, this repository may be used as a reference for initial setup; however, it should not be treated as the authoritative source once the handover process is complete.
